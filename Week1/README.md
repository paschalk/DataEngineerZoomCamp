# Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

GCP is a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google. Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources without direct active management by the user. 

It includes a range of hosted services for compute, storage and application development that run on Google hardware.

For this course, we will learn Big Data, and Storage and Databases.

A service account is an identity that a computer instance or application can user to run API requests on your behalf. In other words, it is a user account one creates for a service. It allows services to interact with each other.


# What is Docker?

Docker is a tool that delivers software in containers, which are isolated from each other, and contain all code and dependencies required to run some service or task eg. a data pipeline

Advantages of using docker include:
1. It is easy to reproduce applications or data pipelines in different environments
2. We can run local experiments and local tests, such as integration tests (CI/CD).
3. We can deploy pipelines in the cloud eg. AWS Batch and Kubernetes jobs
4. We can process services using serverless services eg. AWS Lambda
